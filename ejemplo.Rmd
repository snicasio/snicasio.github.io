## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

<div class = "row">
<div class = "col-md-6">
```{r cars,  warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, dev=c('svg')}
plot(pressure)
```
</div>
<div class = "col-md-6">
```{r pressure, warning = FALSE, echo=FALSE, dev=c('svg')}
plot(pressure)
```
</div>
